# Profiles
I set up profiles per protocol to be more efficient in my analysis for that protocol. Each protocol you see here contains files you can copy to your preferences folder and you should be good. To figure out your preferences folder go to the "about" screen, select the folders tab and look for personal configuration.

## Coloring Rules
Have you noticed that wireshark colors your packets? Each packet is a display filter which can be set up for your needs. You can set up coloring rules for each profile. I have kept an original copy of the coloring rules.
